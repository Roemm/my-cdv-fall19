# Storytelling data visualization

1. [Bruises](https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/bruises-the-data-we-dont-see-1fdec00d0036): It visualizes the data that a mom recorded of her daughter, who suffers from Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, or ITP, an auto-immune disease where her body attacks her platelets so she was getting spontaneous bruises all over her body. It is a daily recorded data that was conducted for 4 months and it includes the condition of her skin, the number of platelets from the blood test, the mother's stress/hope. The data visualization is in the form of petals and therefore eventually creates an artwork from the "cold-blooded" clinic data.

2. [Lessons from those we've lost](https://www.behance.net/gallery/67151247/Lessons-from-those-weve-lost-Data-Visualization): It is a data visualization exploring over a century of extinction. It visualized 120 species in the time frame of 118 years.

3. [Space Oddity](https://www.oddityviz.com/): A visual deconstruction of David Bowie’s Space Oddity. The project visualizes data from Bowie’s 1969 track Space Oddity on a series of 10 specially engraved records with accompanying posters, plus a moving image piece. Each 12-inch disc deconstructs the track in a different way: melodies, harmonies, lyrics, structure, story and other aspects of the music are transformed into new visual systems.
