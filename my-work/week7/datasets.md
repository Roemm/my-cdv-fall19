# Three interesting datasets

- [Trending YouTube Video Statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new)

  - This dataset includes several months (and counting) of data on daily trending YouTube videos. Data is included for the US, GB, DE, CA, and FR regions (USA, Great Britain, Germany, Canada, and France, respectively), with up to 200 listed trending videos per day.

  - It would be interesting to focus only on one country and explore what category the daily top 1 trending video belongs to.



- [The rise of social media](https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-social-media)

  - This dataset explores the rise of social media. It analyses how users are distributed differently across different platforms in terms of their age, gender, class, etc.

  - It could be a gender analysis on how different males/females prefer different social media platforms and how they use them variously.

- [Network Social Capital in East Asia](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/36277/summary)

  - This is a survey focuses on social networks and participation and attitudes toward various social organizations and events. Respondents were asked about common social interactions, family structures and relationships, their neighborhood environments, social support systems, and their trust toward a range of community members and institutions.

  - This is not a numerical dataset but a more descriptive one, but I found the topic is quite interesting. Maybe I could restructure the dataset or find more numerical datasets that are relevant to this topic.
