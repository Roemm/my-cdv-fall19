# Fandom Visualization

### Introduction
By analyzing and visualizing data from fan-created contents uploaded on YouTube, this project tries to demonstrate how different K-pop groups may attract different types of fans and, in return, how those fans help to establish a digital representation of K-pop groups through their spontaneously produced contents. The analyze focuses on the following four groups: [BTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS_(band)), [GOT7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Got7), [BLACKPINK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackpink), and [IZ*ONE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iz%2AOne).

### Process
- **Data Collection**

  I scripted data from YouTube using [YouTube API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search). I searched each group and filtered only the fan-created contents, i.e. contents that are uploaded by non-official channels, and ranked them by views. I then exported data of the top 50 videos of each group to .csv files. I also dived into the channels of the top 10 videos and got data of those 10 channels.
