# Me and My Phone
This project is a visualization of how many times I picked up my phone every two hours. I recorded the data from 8 a.m to midnight for 6 days, from Wednesday to the next Monday.

- For the cover page, I created crescent moon shapes to represent how many times I picked up my phone--the more I picked up my phone, the fuller the moon is. Each row represents one day while each column represents one period time(8-10, 10-12, etc.)

- The second page is a stacked area map which is meant to show when I picked up the phone relatively more often throughout the day. The "times" is stacked on each other day by day and thus visualizes the overall tendency.

- The pie chart on the back page is just to show a weekly average percentage data of the time I spend on the phone.
