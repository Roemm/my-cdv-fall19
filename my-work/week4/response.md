# Data prediction applications

- Apps like Yelp will recommend restaurants based on what you have searched/visited/commented/ordered, and then we often consume based upon these recommendations.

- Input keyboards will predict what you want to type in based on your previous typing habit/chatting history.

- Data is also often used to predict the stock price and it will also affect investments.
