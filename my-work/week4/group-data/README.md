# Me and my phone
I visualized the data I collected about how many times I simply picked up my phone and did nothing with it in 5 days.

The data I collected has three categories:
- day (Wed, Thu, Fri, etc)
- period of time (9am-11am, 11am-1pm, etc)
- times

I tried to create crescent moon shapes with my data. The logic behind is:
- The times of me picking up my phone decides how full the moon is -- the more I picked up my phone, the fuller the moon is
- Each color represents a different days
- The opacity of the shape depends on the period of time, so it gradually fades out

Here is the final outcome:
