- Quote: “What was missing in Rwanda and Srebrenica was not evidence of an atrocity, but the willingness to act upon it. As one investigative report on Rwandan killings noted, ‘Any failure to fully appreciate the genocide stemmed from political, moral and imaginative weaknesses, not informational ones.’ This statement feels like it could be the punchline to this book: a damning indictment of our ability to either ignore or seek more raw information, when the problem is not with our knowing, but with our doing.”

  Thoughts: in the information civilization era, it is worth reflecting on how important information truly is, or to say why information is important in nature. We’ve been told, probably by those capitalists, that gathering information is for improvements but we don’t actually know where it is used. The power dynamic caused by knowledge asymmetry determines that the “willingness” Bridle mentions will still be the minority’s but not the public’s

- Quote: "Empire has mostly rescinded territory, only to continue its operation at the level of infrastructure, maintaining its power in the form of the network. Data-driven regimes repeat the racist, sexist, and oppressive policies of their antecedents because these biases and attitudes have been encoded into them at the root."
  
  Thoughts: Data bias is inevitable. Data is always collected and analyzed subjectively. What we can do, however, is probably being aware of it and not relying solely on data. Data is just showing one portion of the “truth” but never is the truth.


- Quote: “The same is not true of information, despite the desperate fracking that appears to be occurring when intelligence agencies record every email, every mouse click, and the movements of every cell phone. While peak knowledge may be closer than we think, the exploitation of raw information can continue infinitely, along with the damage it does to us and our ability to reckon with the world.
  
  Thoughts: The information civilization is quite unprecedented and we actually don’t know where it will lead us to. All the discussion regrading the future of data extraction and trade is just predictions. Hence, i think we should open to all possibilities and try not to be so pessimistic:)
