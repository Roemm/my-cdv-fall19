### Why "Raw data is both and oxymoron and a bad idea"
Because there is actually no real raw data since all data is gathered subjectively. For instance, data collected from social media sites are already "cleaned" based on some subjective standards. Also, the choice of who to collect data from says a lot about the result. The size of data doesn't equal random and representative data.


### What could be meant by the quote "accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure"?

### In which way is Twitter data limited?
First of all, Twitter users/accounts are not simply equal to people. Multiple accounts can be owned by the same person and one account can be owned by multiple people. The definition of "active users" can also be tricky since lots of people do not post actively on Twitter but rather take it as a platform to learn and listen to information. Also, Twitter has it own system of blocking certein tweets based on their content, which makes the data already "skewed". Besides, the way that relationships are measured online does not reflect the value of each relationship accurately.

### Whether data that does not require login to collect can be considered as public and free to use
I think data that does not require login to collect might be considered as public but that does not mean giving the permission to use and analyze it. Being able to see the data and analyzing it are two entirely different concepts. By using and analyzing data, we can reveal more information, whether accurate or biased, than simply looking at it. Hence, accessibility is not equal to permission.
